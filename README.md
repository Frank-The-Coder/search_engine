## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Python 3.12.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/) (or install using `pyenv` as explained below)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (if you are cloning this repository)

### Using `pyenv` to Install Python 3.12.0 (Optional)

If you don't have Python 3.12.0 installed, you can use `pyenv` to install it. Follow these steps to install `pyenv` and Python 3.12.0:

1. Install `pyenv` using the official instructions [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).

2. Install Python 3.12.0 using `pyenv`:

   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.12.0
   ```

3. Set Python 3.12.0 as the global version

```bash
pyenv global 3.12.0
```

Alternatively, set it locally

```bash
pyenv local 3.12.0
```

## Set Up and Activate the Virtual Environment

Create and activate the virtual environment:
On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Install the Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is active, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

This command installs all the libraries listed in requirements.txt into the virtual environment.

## Deactivating the Virtual Environment

To exit the virtual environment, run the following command:

```
deactivate
```

This will return you to the global Python environment.

## Running and testing the app

1. Running
To run the app:
```bash
cd src/
python app.py
```

The website will be hosted on https://localhost:8080

2. Testing

```bash
cd test/
python test_crawler.py
```


# Deploy configuration

The web application is deployed using AWS

OS: ubuntu 22.04 LTS hvm:ebs-ssd

## Creating a new instance for deploy

1. Generate your ssh keypair for aws and the security group for the security group id

2. Create the new instance using the launch_ec2.py under deploy
```
python launch_ec2.py --create-instance --keyname="your_key_name" --security-group-id="security-group-id"
```
3. (Optional) Associate the elastic ip to your instance, if you have already allocated one
```
python3 launch_ec2.py --associate-address --instance-id="instance_id"
```
4. scp the repo to the aws instance

## Running the webapp on the instance

1. launching the webapp on aws instance:
- The web app is already running on the instance
- run this step only if you are creating a new instance
```
cd src
sudo env "PATH=$PATH" python3 app.py
```

2. Configuring the ssh tunnel (on your local machine)
```
ssh -i /path/to/aws/key.pem -L 8080:localhost:8080 utunbu@ec2-23-22-39-109.compute-1.amazonaws.com

```

3. Access the webapp on your machine through `http://localhost:8080`

# Benchmark setup
To benchmark the deployed web application on AWS, we used Apache Benchmark (ab) for load testing and tools like dstat and vmstat for monitoring system resources.
The benchmark was run in Anonymous Mode from a separate machine to avoid resource contention on the server.
The ab tests included 1000 total requests (-n 1000) with an incrementally increased concurrency level (-c), 
starting from 10 and moving upwards until the serverâ€™s limit was reached without connection drops. 
A 60-second timeout (-s 60) ensured requests had ample time to complete under heavy load. 
For system monitoring, dstat captured real-time CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network utilization, 
while vmstat logged CPU and memory usage throughout the test. Key performance metrics included maximum sustained connections, 
peak requests per second (RPS), average response time, 99th percentile latency, and detailed resource utilization 
(CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network) under load. These results, along with the system's maximum performance capacities, 
are documented in the RESULT file.
